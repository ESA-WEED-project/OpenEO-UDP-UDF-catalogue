# OpenEO-UDP-UDF-catalogue

Catalogue to store UDP (user-defined processes) and UDF (user-defined functions) which can be called in OpenEO.
The UDP/UDF's will be called via their URL.

Currently, this repository is a fork of the UDP/UDF repository for the ARIES-4-PEOPLE-EA app. In the future this repository will replace the old one!
